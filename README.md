# XYZ Bank Deposit Optimization Project

## Project Introduction
Welcome to the XYZ Bank Deposit Optimization project. This repository holds detailed documentation and code that demonstrates our approach to strategically optimizing discount allocations to enhance customer retention and maximize revenue in a subscription-based business model.

## [MiniProject2-SFRRAnalytics.ipynb](./MiniProject2-SFRRAnalytics.ipynb)
This Jupyter notebook contains the practical implementation of the analyses described in the PDF. It includes:
- Code for performing EDA to understand the impact of discounts on customer lifetime.
- Transformations to linearize the relationship between discount rates and lifetime increases for more accurate modeling.
- Regression models built for each customer tier (High, Mid, Low) to forecast the effects of discounts.
- A linear optimization model that calculates the most revenue-efficient way to allocate discounts across different customer segments.
- Display of final solutions and quantitative analysis comparing scenarios with and without optimization.

This document from Team SFRR Analytics presents a comprehensive optimization exercise aimed at enhancing revenue through strategic discounting for a subscription-based business. The report is structured as follows:

- Project Objective: Develop a discounting model to extend customer retention and increase revenue, categorizing customers into high, medium, and low-value tiers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis to understand the relationship between discounts and customer lifetime extensions across different tiers.
- Methodology:
  - Predictive Modeling: Build regression models for each customer tier to predict the impact of discounts on customer lifetime extension.
  - Optimization Modeling: Use linear optimization to determine the best distribution of discounts that maximizes revenue while adhering to the Chief Marketing Officer's constraint of limiting discounts to 20% of the customer base.
- Results and Recommendations: Outline the optimal discount distribution strategy and its expected impact on revenue.

## Final Solutions: Revenue Impact
- Distribution of Customers by Tier & Discount Depth:
  - High: 0% Discount = 40,000
  - Mid: 0% Discount = 10,000, 20% Discount = 15,000
  - Low: 0% Discount = 10,000
- Total Revenue Generated With Optimization: $57,360,857
- Total Revenue Generated Without Optimization: $51,000,000
- Incremental Revenue Generated: $6,360,857
